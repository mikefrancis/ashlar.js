Planning to contribute? Awesome! 

Please make sure you have [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) installed and once you've got the repo, run:

    npm install
    
to install Grunt and the devDependancies through Node Package Manager. This might take a while as I've plumped for grunt-contrib due to the extensive tasks it includes - but at the time of writing this, I'm only really using grunt-contrib-uglify.

To keep the ashlar.js nice and light, please commit your ashlar.min.js along with the main file - making sure the uglified code is mangled as well as compressed.
